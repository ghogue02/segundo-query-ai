## 🔍 Key Areas to Focus On

### 1. Data Accuracy (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Validate these specific values:**
- Total active builders should be **76** (after exclusions)
- Class days should be **19** (Sept 6 - Oct 1, excluding Thu/Fri)
- Total curriculum tasks should be **107**
- Dwight Williams (user_id: 141) should have **21 submissions**
- Greg Hogue (user_id: 5) should be **EXCLUDED** from all results

### 2. Metric Definitions (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Verify calculations match Terminology Legend:**
- Attendance = Check-ins on Mon-Wed, Sat-Sun only (NO Thu/Fri)
- Task Completion = ANY interaction with task (not quality-based)
- 7-Day Class Average = Only counts class days (excludes Thu/Fri)
- Struggling Builder has TWO definitions (threshold vs composite)

### 3. User Experience (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Evaluate ease of use:**
- Can a non-technical facilitator use this?
- Is navigation intuitive?
- Are visualizations clear?
- Do drill-downs provide value?
- Are errors handled gracefully?

### 4. Performance (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Measure and report:**
- Homepage load time
- Query response time (average of 5 queries)
- Dashboard initial load
- Filter change response time
- API endpoint response times

### 5. Improvement Opportunities (LOW PRIORITY)
**Identify quick wins:**
- Missing features that would add value
- UX/UI enhancements
- Better visualizations
- Workflow improvements

## 🧪 Testing Methodology

### Step 1: Systematic Testing (2-3 hours)
Go through **all 19 sections** in the testing guide systematically.
Document findings in each section.

### Step 2: User Simulation (30 minutes)
Pretend to be these personas:
- **Facilitator checking daily attendance**
- **Program manager preparing weekly report**
- **Leadership reviewing cohort progress**

Document pain points and delights.

### Step 3: Edge Case Exploration (30 minutes)
Try to break things:
- Invalid filters
- Malformed queries
- Extreme values
- Rapid clicking
- Network interruptions (if testable)

### Step 4: Synthesis (30 minutes)
Compile findings into:
- **Top 10 bugs** (prioritized)
- **Top 10 improvements** (with effort estimates)
- **Overall assessment** (ready to launch?)

## 📞 Questions to Answer

**Your testing should definitively answer:**

1. **Is the data trustworthy?** (Most important per transcript)
2. **Can facilitators use this daily?**
3. **Does it answer the questions teams actually ask?**
4. **Are metrics defined clearly enough?**
5. **Is it ready to present to Dave on Wednesday?**
6. **What's the #1 improvement needed?**
7. **What's the #1 thing that works really well?**

---

## 🔄 Iterative Testing

**After fixes are implemented:**
1. Re-test failed test cases
2. Verify improvements don't break other features
3. Update testing guide with new scenarios
4. Maintain test results for future reference
