- **Before**: Dwight Williams showed 20 tasks (inflated from June cohort)
- **After**: Dwight Williams shows 7 tasks (September 2025 only) ✅

**Issue Fixed**: Wrong completion tracking table
- **Before**: Used user_task_progress (empty) = 0% for all
- **After**: Uses task_submissions + task_threads = 50-95% range ✅

**Issue Fixed**: Late arrivals counted as absent
