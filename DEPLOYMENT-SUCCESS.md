## 🛠️ For Future Development

### Adding New Components:
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```

### Before Every Deploy:
```bash
npm run build  # Must pass
npx vercel --yes
```

### If CSS Breaks:
1. Check `app/globals.css` has proper format
2. Verify :root variables wrapped in hsl()
3. Ensure @theme inline exists
4. Confirm no tailwind.config.ts file
