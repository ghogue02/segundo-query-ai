## 🔄 What Still Needs Work (Optional)

### Hypothesis Charts Drill-Downs (80% done)
- ✅ H7 clickable (shows all tasks)
- ⚠️ H1, H2, H4 have drill-down APIs but charts not yet wrapped
- ⚠️ H3, H5 need drill-down APIs created

**To complete:** Wrap each chart in clickable div + add modal

### Builder Detail Pages
- ✅ Links exist in drill-down tables
- ⚠️ `/builder/[id]` route exists but needs full redes
