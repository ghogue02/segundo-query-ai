## ⚠️ **ONE MANUAL STEP REQUIRED**

Your app has **Vercel Authentication** protection enabled by default. This needs to be disabled for public access.

### How to Disable (2 minutes):

#### **Option 1: Via Vercel Dashboard** (Recommended)

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/gregs-projects-61e51c01/segundo-query-ai/settings/deployment-protection**

2. Find "Vercel Authentication" section

3. Click **"Disable"** or toggle it OFF

4. Click **"Save"**

That's it! Your app will be publicly accessible in ~10 seconds.

---

## 🌐 Your Production URLs

Once deployment protection is disabled:

### **Main App**
```
https://segundo-query-jr8lrlxix-gregs-projects-61e51c01.vercel.app
```

### **Custom Domain** (Optional - Can Add Later)
You can add a custom domain like:
- `segundo-query.your-domain.com`
- `analytics.pursuit.org`

Add at: https://vercel.com/gregs-projects-61e51c01/segundo-query-ai/settings/domains

---

## 🧪 Test After Disabling Protection

Once protection is disabled, test these endpoints:

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://segundo-query-jr8lrlxix-gregs-projects-61e51c01.vercel.app/api/health
```
Expected: `{"status":"healthy","database":"connected","claude":"configured"}`

### 2. Homepage
```
https://segundo-query-jr8lrlxix-gregs-projects-61e51c01.vercel.app
```
Should show the query interface with 15 pre-prompt buttons.

### 3. Try a Query
Click any pre-prompt query or type your own question!

## 📈 What's Working Right Now

Even with protection enabled, the following work:
- ✅ Build pipeline
- ✅ Environment variables
- ✅ Database connection (when called server-side)
- ✅ API routes (when authenticated)
- ✅ Serverless functions

**Once protection is disabled**, everything will be publicly accessible!
