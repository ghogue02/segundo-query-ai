## üîç **Query Design Philosophy**

Each query is designed to:
1. **Answer a specific question** - Not vague "show data"
2. **Suggest an action** - Results lead to decisions
3. **Be contextual** - Relevant to program operations
4. **Trigger AI clarification** - Most will ask follow-ups
5. **Return clickable data** - Drill down for details

---

## üìä **Expected Clarifications**

### "Which builders need additional support?"
**AI will ask**: "How would you like to identify builders needing support? 1) By engagement score (<60%), 2) By attendance patterns (<80%), or 3) By task completion progress (<50%)?"

### "Show attendance trends for this week"
**AI will ask**: "What time period? 1) Current week (Sept 23-29), 2) Last 7 days, or 3) All time (Sept 6-30)?"

### "Which tasks have the lowest completion rates?"
**AI will ask**: "Would you like to see: 1) Bottom 20 tasks across all days, 2) Tasks with <30% completion (never attempted), or 3) Bottom tasks from a specific time period?"
