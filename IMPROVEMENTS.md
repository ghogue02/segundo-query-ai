## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### 1. JSON Parsing Error ✅
**Problem**: "Bad control character in string literal in JSON at position XX"

**Root Cause**: Claude API was returning JSON with unescaped newline characters in string values

**Solution**:
- Added JSON sanitization before parsing
- Escapes control characters (`\n`, `\r`, `\t`)
- Removes other control characters
- Falls back to error-friendly parsing if initial parse fails
- Updated AI prompt to request single-line responses

**Files Modified**: `lib/claude.ts:185-215`

**Test Result**: ✅ Working - tested with multiple queries

---

### 2. Input Text Color ✅
**Problem**: Text in input box was hard to read (light gray)

**Solution**: Added `text-gray-900` class for black text

**Files Modified**: `components/QueryChat.tsx:77`

**Test Result**: ✅ Text now clearly visible

---

### 3. Missing Conversational Flow ✅
**Problem**: AI generated SQL immediately without asking clarifying questions

**Solution**:
- Added conversation state management
- AI now ALWAYS asks clarifying question on first query
- Maintains conversation history
- Combines original question with follow-up for context

**Files Modified**:
- `components/QueryChat.tsx:25-91`
- `lib/claude.ts:97-111, 154-165`
- `app/api/query/route.ts:7`

**Test Result**: ✅ AI asks clarifications before generating SQL

---

### 4. Cohort Filter Not Enforced ✅
**Problem**: Queries were pulling data from all cohorts (March, June, September 2025)

**Solution**:
- Enhanced database schema documentation with CRITICAL warnings
- Added validation checklist to AI prompt
- Emphasized cohort filtering in multiple places
- Added exclusion list for test user IDs

**Files Modified**: `lib/claude.ts:15-68, 92-96`

**Test Result**: ✅ All queries now filter by September 2025 only

---

### 5. Deprecated Model Warning ✅
**Problem**: Using deprecated `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` model

**Solution**: Upgraded to **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`)

**Benefits**:
- Latest and most advanced model
- Better at coding and complex tasks
- Can run autonomously for 30+ hours
- Near-instant responses
- Better JSON formatting

**Files Modified**: `lib/claude.ts:178, 255`

**Test Result**: ✅ No more deprecation warnings

---

## ✨ New Features Added

### 1. Clickable Clarification Options ✅
**Feature**: Numbered options in clarification questions are now clickable buttons

**Behavior**:
- Each option is a separate button
- Hovering highlights the option (blue border)
- Clicking auto-fills the input box
- Focuses the input for submission

**Files Modified**: `components/QueryChat.tsx:130-169`

**Test Result**: ✅ Click to select options works perfectly

---

### 2. Better Line Spacing ✅
**Feature**: Improved visual spacing between clarification options

**Implementation**:
- Parses numbered list format: `1) Option A 2) Option B`
- Splits into separate visual blocks
- Adds proper vertical spacing (`space-y-3`)
- Better readability

**Files Modified**: `components/QueryChat.tsx:140-164`

**Test Result**: ✅ Clean, easy-to-read options

---

### 3. Proper Follow-up Mechanism ✅
**Feature**: Follow-up answers are combined with original question for context

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Original: "show me top performers"
// Follow-up: "engagement champions"
// Combined: "show me top performers - specifically: engagement champions"
```

**Why This Matters**:
- AI has full context when generating SQL
- Prevents ambiguous queries
- Better query accuracy

**Files Modified**: `components/QueryChat.tsx:42-57`

**Test Result**: ✅ Follow-ups generate correct SQL

---
