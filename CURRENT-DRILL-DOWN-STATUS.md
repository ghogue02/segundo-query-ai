2. Modal opens with 22 builders
3. Click builder name (e.g., "Builder X")
4. Opens builder profile page
5. See all their stats, attendance, completed tasks

**Builder names are clickable in:**
- ‚úÖ Attendance Today drill-down

## üìã What Remains (10% of work)

### Make Hypothesis Charts Clickable (Charts H1-H6)
Currently:
- ‚úÖ Drill-down APIs exist for H1, H2, H4
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Charts not wrapped to be clickable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to add DrillDownModal to each chart

**Simple fix:** Wrap chart div + add modal (5 min per chart)
