# Attendance History Fix - Complete Status Display

## Problem Statement
Builder profile attendance history was only showing days with 'present' or 'late' status. Days where builders were absent (no check-in) were completely missing from the history.

## Root Cause
Both query implementations were selecting FROM `builder_attendance_new` and LEFT JOINing to `curriculum_days`, which meant only days WITH attendance records appeared in results.

**Old Query Pattern (WRONG):**
```sql
SELECT ...
FROM builder_attendance_new ba
LEFT JOIN curriculum_days cd ON ...
WHERE ba.user_id = $1
```
This only returns rows where `ba.user_id = $1` exists, missing all absent days.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Database Query (`lib/queries/builderQueries.ts`)

**New Query Pattern (CORRECT):**
```sql
SELECT
  cd.day_date as attendance_date,
  ba.check_in_time AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York' as check_in_time,
  COALESCE(ba.status, 'absent') as status,
  ba.late_arrival_minutes,
  cd.day_number,
  cd.day_type
FROM curriculum_days cd
LEFT JOIN builder_attendance_new ba ON ba.attendance_date = cd.day_date AND ba.user_id = $1
WHERE cd.cohort = 'September 2025'
  AND EXTRACT(DOW FROM cd.day_date) NOT IN (4, 5)
  AND cd.day_date <= CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY cd.day_date DESC;
```

**Key Changes:**
- âœ… SELECT FROM `curriculum_days` (base table with all official curriculum days)
- âœ… LEFT JOIN to `builder_attendance_new` (brings in check-in data when exists)
- âœ… `COALESCE(ba.status, 'absent')` - defaults to 'absent' when no check-in record
- âœ… Filter by cohort = 'September 2025' (CRITICAL - multiple cohorts run simultaneously)
- âœ… Exclude Thu/Fri (no classes on these days)
- âœ… Only include dates up to today (`cd.day_date <= CURRENT_DATE`)
- âœ… Order by date DESC (most recent first)

### 2. Fixed Frontend Query (`app/builder/[id]/page.tsx`)

Applied same pattern to the builder profile page's attendance history query (lines 197-209).

### 3. Added Status Badge Colors (`app/builder/[id]/page.tsx`)

```typescript
const statusColors = {
  present: 'bg-green-100 text-green-800 border-green-200',
  late: 'bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800 border-yellow-200',
  absent: 'bg-red-100 text-red-800 border-red-200',
  excused: 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-600 border-gray-200',
};
```

**Visual Indicators:**
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green badge** â†’ 'present' (checked in on time)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow badge** â†’ 'late' (checked in late)
- ðŸ”´ **Red badge** â†’ 'absent' (no check-in)
- âšª **Gray badge** â†’ 'excused' (if status exists in DB)

## Database Status Verification

**Current Status Values in DB:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT status FROM builder_attendance_new ORDER BY status;
```
Result: `late`, `present`

**Note:** The database only stores 'present' and 'late'. The 'absent' status is derived from the query when no attendance record exists for a curriculum day.

## Testing Results

### Test Case 1: Builder with No Check-ins (User ID: 1)
```
Total curriculum days: 23
Days with check-in: 0
Present days: 0
Late days: 0
Absent days: 23
```
**Result:** âœ… All 23 days show as 'absent'

### Test Case 2: Builder with Mixed Attendance (User ID: 324)
```
Total curriculum days: 23
Days with check-in: 14
Present days: 4
Late days: 10
Absent days: 9
```

**Sample History (Most Recent 15 Days):**
| Date | Status | Day Number |
|------|--------|------------|
| 2025-10-07 | absent | 23 |
| 2025-10-06 | late | 22 |
| 2025-10-05 | late | 21 |
| 2025-10-04 | late | 20 |
| 2025-10-01 | late | 19 |
| 2025-09-30 | late | 18 |
| 2025-09-29 | present | 17 |
| 2025-09-28 | late | 16 |
| 2025-09-27 | late | 15 |
| 2025-09-24 | absent | 14 |
| 2025-09-23 | present | 13 |
| 2025-09-22 | present | 12 |
| 2025-09-21 | late | 11 |
| 2025-09-20 | absent | 10 |
| 2025-09-17 | late | 9 |

**Result:** âœ… Shows complete history with all statuses (present, late, absent)

## Build Verification

```bash
npm run build
```

**Status:** âœ… Build completed successfully
- No TypeScript errors
- All routes compiled
- Production build ready for deployment

**Warnings:** Only minor unused variable warnings (non-breaking)

## Files Modified

1. `/lib/queries/builderQueries.ts` (lines 169-187)
   - Updated `getBuilderAttendance()` function

2. `/app/builder/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 197-209, 107-128)
   - Updated attendance query
   - Added status badge color mapping

3. `/app/api/builder/[id]/route.ts` (no changes)
   - Already calling `getBuilderAttendance()` which now returns all statuses

## API Response Structure

The `/api/builder/[id]` endpoint now returns:

```json
{
  "attendance": [
    {
      "attendance_date": "2025-10-07",
      "check_in_time": null,
      "status": "absent",
      "late_arrival_minutes": null,
      "day_number": 23,
      "day_type": "Weekday"
    },
    {
      "attendance_date": "2025-10-06",
      "check_in_time": "2025-10-06T19:15:23-04:00",
      "status": "late",
      "late_arrival_minutes": 45,
      "day_number": 22,
      "day_type": "Weekday"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Timezone Handling

- All check-in times are converted to EST (`America/New_York`)
- Dates are in format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `CURRENT_DATE` uses database server's current date
- Thu/Fri exclusion uses `EXTRACT(DOW FROM ...)` (DOW 4=Thu, 5=Fri)

## Exclusions Applied

- **Days:** Thursday and Friday (no classes)
- **Cohort:** Only 'September 2025' cohort days
- **Date Range:** Only dates up to and including today

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Local Testing:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit: http://localhost:3000/builder/324
   ```

2. **API Testing:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/builder/324
   ```

3. **Verify Display:**
   - Navigate to any builder profile
   - Check "Attendance History" card
   - Verify all 23 days appear (including absences)
   - Verify color coding: green (present), yellow (late), red (absent)
