# Pattern Analysis Approach - Task Completion Quality
**Based on:** Greg's Clarification (Oct 2, 2025)
**Key Insight:** Use existing BigQuery scores + analyze cohort-level text patterns

---

## 🎯 Corrected Understanding

### ❌ WRONG Approach (What I Was Proposing)
- Re-score individual submissions with AI
- Create new quality metrics
- Duplicate existing BigQuery data

### ✅ RIGHT Approach (What You Want)
- **Use existing quality scores from BigQuery** (don't re-score)
- **Analyze text patterns across entire cohort** (aggregate analysis)
- **Find insights from large sample size** (76 builders × 107 tasks)

---

## 📊 Two-Part Quality System

### Part 1: Individual Quality Scores (BigQuery)
**Source:** Already exists in `assessment_feedback` table
```sql
-- Pull existing scores
SELECT
  user_id,
  task_id,
  rubric_scores, -- Technical Skills, Business Value, etc.
  overall_score,
  feedback_text
FROM assessment_feedback
WHERE cohort = 'September 2025'
```

**Use for:**
- Individual builder quality metrics
- Quality radar chart (by rubric category)
- Top performer identification (composite score with quality component)

---

### Part 2: Cohort Pattern Analysis (NEW - What You Want)
**Analyze text submissions at aggregate level to answer:**

1. **How did the cohort interact with this task?**
   - What approaches did most builders take?
   - What common patterns emerge?
   - Where did most builders get stuck?

2. **What does the text data reveal at scale?**
   - Depth of responses (superficial vs thorough)
   - Common misconceptions
   - Evidence of understanding vs confusion
   - Copy-paste patterns (similar wording = potential collaboration or AI over-reliance)

3. **Which tasks need redesign?**
   - Tasks with low-quality patterns across cohort
   - Tasks where text shows confusion/frustration
   - Tasks where submissions are too short/generic

---

## 🔍 Pattern Analysis Implementation

### Approach: Aggregate Task Analysis

**Run once per task (not per submission):**

```javascript
async function analyzeTaskPatterns(taskId) {
  // Get ALL submissions for this task across cohort
  const submissions = await db.query(`
    SELECT
      ts.user_id,
      ts.thread_content, -- All text interactions
      ts.created_at,
      u.first_name,
      u.last_name
    FROM task_submissions ts
    JOIN users u ON ts.user_id = u.user_id
    WHERE ts.task_id = $1
      AND u.cohort = 'September 2025'
      AND u.active = true
      AND u.user_id NOT IN (129,5,240,324,325,326,9,327,329,331,330,328,332)
  `, [taskId]);

  // Aggregate analysis prompt
  const prompt = `
    Analyze these ${submissions.length} submissions for Task "${task.title}":

    SUBMISSIONS:
    ${submissions.map((s, i) => `
      Builder ${i + 1}: ${s.thread_content}
    `).join('\n---\n')}

    Provide cohort-level pattern analysis:

    1. INTERACTION PATTERNS:
       - What approaches did most builders take?
       - Common strategies or methods used
       - Range of response lengths (min/max/avg)

    2. UNDERSTANDING INDICATORS:
       - % showing deep understanding
       - % showing partial understanding
       - % showing confusion/struggling
       - Common misconceptions

    3. QUALITY DISTRIBUTION:
       - High quality responses: X%
       - Medium quality: X%
       - Low quality: X%
       - Explanation of what differentiates them

    4. RED FLAGS:
       - Tasks where cohort struggled
       - Patterns indicating task redesign needed
       - Evidence of copy-paste or over-reliance on AI
       - Unusually short or generic responses

    5. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS:
       - What this tells us about the task design
       - Recommendations for facilitators
       - Curriculum improvement suggestions

    Return JSON format.
  `;

  const analysis = await claude.analyze(prompt);

  // Store aggregate analysis (not per-builder)
  await db.query(`
    INSERT INTO task_pattern_analysis
    (task_id, total_submissions, analysis_results, analyzed_at)
    VALUES ($1, $2, $3, NOW())
  `, [taskId, submissions.length, analysis]);

  return analysis;
}
```

## ⚡ Analysis Frequency

### Real-time: Individual Metrics
- Submission count: Instant
- Existing BigQuery quality scores: Pull on demand

### Batch Analysis: Pattern Insights
**Run nightly or weekly (configurable):**
- Analyze tasks with >10 new submissions since last run
- Update pattern analysis for modified tasks
- Generate cohort-level insights

**Reasoning:**
- Patterns need critical mass (10+ submissions)
- Daily updates sufficient for curriculum insights
- Lower cost than real-time analysis

---

## 🎯 Key Hypotheses Using Pattern Data

### H7 (Enhanced): Task Quality Patterns
**Question:** Which tasks consistently produce low-quality cohort responses?

**Chart:** Scatter plot
- X-axis: Task completion rate
- Y-axis: % of cohort with "deep understanding"
- Color: Red (redesign needed), Yellow (review), Green (working well)

**Insight:** Tasks in bottom-left quadrant (low completion + low understanding) need redesign

### H8 (NEW): Understanding Progression
**Question:** Does cohort understanding depth improve over time?

**Chart:** Line chart
- X-axis: Week number
- Y-axis: % of cohort with deep understanding
- Shows learning trajectory

### H9 (NEW): Task Type Effectiveness
**Question:** Which task categories produce best understanding?

**Chart:** Bar chart comparing:
- Learning tasks
- Building tasks
- Reflection tasks
- Group activities

By "deep understanding %" from pattern analysis

---

## ✅ Confirmed Approach

### What We're Building:

1. **Pull existing BigQuery scores** (don't re-score)
2. **Aggregate pattern analysis per task** (cohort-level insights)
3. **Dashboard shows:**
   - Individual quality scores (from BigQuery)
   - Cohort patterns (from text analysis)
   - Task effectiveness heatmap
   - Common misconceptions
   - Red flags for curriculum redesign

### What We're NOT Building:
- ❌ Individual submission re-scoring
- ❌ Duplicate quality metrics
- ❌ Real-time per-submission analysis

---

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Data Integration (Week 1)
- [ ] Connect to BigQuery for existing quality scores
- [ ] Create `task_pattern_analysis` table
- [ ] Build pattern analysis script

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement aggregate text analysis
- [ ] Run on all September tasks
- [ ] Validate insights with facilitators

### Phase 3: Dashboard Integration (Week 3)
- [ ] Task quality heatmap
- [ ] Common misconceptions tracker
- [ ] Response quality distribution
- [ ] Anomaly detection alerts

### Phase 4: Automation (Week 4)
- [ ] Nightly batch analysis
- [ ] Alert system for red flags
- [ ] Pattern trend tracking

---

## ❓ Final Confirmation

**This approach correct?**
- ✅ Use existing BigQuery quality scores
- ✅ Analyze text patterns at cohort level (aggregate)
- ✅ Find insights from large sample size (76 builders)
- ✅ Identify which tasks need redesign
- ✅ Track common misconceptions
- ✅ Flag anomalies (similar responses, too short, etc.)

**Confirm:** YES / Need adjustments: _____

**Also need:**
- BigQuery credentials for quality scores table
- Confirm table name: `assessment_feedback` or different?
- Should pattern analysis run nightly or weekly?
