# ✅ Dynamic Week Ranges - Implementation Summary

## What Changed

The system now **automatically calculates** all 8 weeks for the September 2025 cohort based on the cohort start date (Sept 6, 2025).

---

## Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Week Generation**
- ✅ Calculates all 8 weeks from Sept 6 - Oct 29, 2025
- ✅ Each week runs Saturday to Friday (7 days)
- ✅ Handles month transitions automatically (Sept → Oct)

### 2. **Current Week Detection**
- ✅ System knows **today is Week 5** (Oct 4, 2025)
- ✅ Highlights current week with "Current" badge
- ✅ Auto-selects weeks 1-5 by default (all past + current)

### 3. **Future-Proof**
- ✅ As time progresses, current week updates automatically
- ✅ Week 6, 7, 8 will become current as dates arrive
- ✅ No manual updates needed throughout the cohort

## Visual Changes in Filter Sidebar

### Before (Hardcoded):
```
☑ Week 1 (Sept 6-12)
☑ Week 2 (Sept 13-19)
☑ Week 3 (Sept 20-26)
☑ Week 4 (Sept 27-Oct 1)
```
*Only 4 weeks, hardcoded dates, missing weeks 5-8*

### After (Dynamic):
```
☑ Week 1 (Sept 6-12)
☑ Week 2 (Sept 13-19)
☑ Week 3 (Sept 20-26)
☑ Week 4 (Sept 27-Oct 3)
☑ Week 5 (Oct 4-10)          [Current] ← Bold + Blue badge
☐ Week 6 (Oct 11-17)
☐ Week 7 (Oct 18-24)
☐ Week 8 (Oct 25-29)
```
*All 8 weeks, accurate dates, current week highlighted*

## API Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/cohort/weeks?cohort=September%202025`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "cohort": "September 2025",
  "currentWeek": 5,
  "totalWeeks": 8,
  "weeks": [
    {"weekNumber": 1, "dateRange": "Sept 6-12", "isCurrent": false},
    {"weekNumber": 2, "dateRange": "Sept 13-19", "isCurrent": false},
    {"weekNumber": 3, "dateRange": "Sept 20-26", "isCurrent": false},
    {"weekNumber": 4, "dateRange": "Sept 27-Oct 3", "isCurrent": false},
    {"weekNumber": 5, "dateRange": "Oct 4-10", "isCurrent": true},
    {"weekNumber": 6, "dateRange": "Oct 11-17", "isCurrent": false},
    {"weekNumber": 7, "dateRange": "Oct 18-24", "isCurrent": false},
    {"weekNumber": 8, "dateRange": "Oct 25-29", "isCurrent": false}
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

### 1. Cohort Config (Single Source of Truth)
```typescript
'September 2025': {
  startDate: new Date('2025-09-06'),  // Saturday
  endDate: new Date('2025-10-29'),    // Wednesday
  totalWeeks: 8
}
```

### 2. Automatic Calculation
- **Week 1:** Starts on cohort start date (Sept 6)
- **Each Week:** 7 days (Saturday → Friday)
- **Week 8:** Ends on cohort end date (Oct 29, only 5 days)

### 3. Current Week Detection
- Compares today's date with week ranges
- Returns current week number (5 as of Oct 4)
- Updates automatically as time passes

---

## Adding Future Cohorts

Simply add to `COHORTS` object in `/lib/utils/cohort-dates.ts`:

```typescript
'January 2026': {
  name: 'January 2026',
  startDate: new Date('2026-01-10'),  // Your start date
  endDate: new Date('2026-03-15'),    // Your end date
  totalWeeks: 10
}
```

Everything else updates automatically!
