## Failed Test Details

### ⚠️ Failed Test: Filter Counts API
**Test:** Export count badges
**Status:** FAIL ❌

**Issue:**
- Filter counts API returns 500 error
- SQL error: `column ba.cohort does not exist`
- Location: `/app/api/metrics/filter-counts/route.ts:31`

**Impact:**
- Count badges don't display (e.g., "Top Performers (24)")
- Cosmetic issue only - site fully functional

**Severity:** LOW (non-blocking)

**Production Impact:** MINIMAL (badges won't show, but filters still work)

**Workaround:** Site operates perfectly without count badges

**Fix Required:** Change `ba.cohort` to `cd.cohort` in SQL query (1 hour)
