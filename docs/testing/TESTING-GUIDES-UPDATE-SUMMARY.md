## 🎯 Critical Testing Principles Embedded

### 1. **Data Accuracy is Priority #1**
- Weighted 25% (highest) in scoring formulas
- Mandatory database verification for all metrics
- Discrepancies flagged as CRITICAL BUGS

### 2. **Assume Broken Until Proven Working**
- Test edge cases that should fail
- Look for what's missing, not just what works
- Document every minor issue

### 3. **Realistic Scoring**
- 5/5 = EXCEPTIONAL (rare)
- 4/5 = GOOD (production ready)
- 3.5-4.5/5 = NORMAL for production software
- Grade inflation is discouraged

### 4. **Issue Documentation Standards**
Every issue must have:
- Severity (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Description
- Impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Suggested fix

### 5. **Mandatory Improvement Suggestions**
Even 5/5 perfect features need minimum 2 suggestions for post-launch iteration

## 🎓 Training Example for AI Agents

### WRONG Approach (v1.0 style):
```markdown
## Test 4.1: Attendance Today KPI

Functionality: ✅ Works
Data: Shows 44/76
UX: Looks good
Score: 5/5
```

### CORRECT Approach (v2.0 style):
```markdown
## Test 4.1: Attendance Today KPI

### ✅ Functionality (4/5)
- Card displays ✅
- Drill-down works ✅
- Issue: No loading state on filter change

### 📊 Data Accuracy (5/5)
- Displayed: 44/76
- DB Query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM builder_attendance_new WHERE...
- Result: 44 ✅ MATCH

### 🧪 Edge Cases (3/5)
- Thu/Fri: ⚠️ Shows 0 (should show "No class today" message)
- Future date: ❌ BUG - Returns invalid data

### ⚡ Performance (5/5)
- API: 321ms ✅
- Render: <100ms ✅

### 🎨 UX (3/5)
- ❌ No tooltip explaining metric
- ❌ Percentage not shown
- ✅ Clean visual design

### ♿ Accessibility (3/5)
- ⚠️ No keyboard interaction
- ❌ Missing ARIA labels
- ✅ Good contrast (8.2:1)

### 🚨 Error Handling (4/5)
- ✅ API failure shows error
- ⚠️ No retry button

### 🐛 Issues Found
1. [MEDIUM] No tooltip
2. [LOW] No loading state
3. [MEDIUM] Missing keyboard interaction
4. [HIGH] Thu/Fri shows 0 instead of message
5. [MEDIUM] Future dates return invalid data

### 💡 Improvements
1. Add tooltip: "Builders present today"
2. Show percentage: "44/76 (57.9%)"
3. Add loading skeleton
4. Keyboard: Enter/Space to drill-down
5. Handle Thu/Fri: "No class today"

### 🎯 Score: 3.7/5
**Calculation:** (4×0.2)+(5×0.25)+(3×0.15)+(5×0.15)+(3×0.15)+(3×0.05)+(4×0.05) = 3.93/5
**Justification:** Works well with accurate data, but UX needs improvement
