### Test 1.2: Thursday/Friday Context 🔴 CRITICAL FAILURE

**Functionality Checks:**
- ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUE:** Message displays "No class today (Thursday)" when today is actually **Saturday**
- ✅ Contextual message is present and visible
- ❌ The day of the week detection is incorrect

**UX/UI Evaluation:**
- **Context Messaging Quality:** Clear and prominent (but incorrect data)

**Critical Finding:**
The application incorrectly identifies the current day as Thursday when it's Saturday. This is a **critical data integrity issue** that breaks the contextual messaging feature.

**Impact:**
- Users receive misleading information about the class schedule
- Could cause confusion about when classes are held
- Undermines trust in the application's data accuracy

**Root Cause (Suspected):**
- Date/day detection logic may be using incorrect timezone
- Possible hardcoded values or stale cache
- Server time vs client time mismatch

**Recommendation:** **MUST FIX BEFORE PRODUCTION** - Fix day-of-week detection logic immediately

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)

### 🔴 P1: Incorrect Day Detection
**Issue:** Application shows "No class today (Thursday)" when current day is Saturday
**Impact:** Misleading information that could confuse users about schedule
**Location:** Homepage (landing page)
**Recommendation:** Fix date/day detection logic to correctly identify current day of week
**Priority:** **CRITICAL - BLOCKING**

**Suggested Fix:**
```javascript
// Verify timezone handling and ensure correct day-of-week calculation
const today = new Date();
const dayOfWeek = today.getDay(); // 0=Sunday, 6=Saturday
const dayNames = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'];
const isThursdayOrFriday = dayOfWeek === 4 || dayOfWeek === 5;
```

---

### 🟡 P2: Task Count Discrepancy
**Issue:** Homepage shows 107 tasks, expected 112 (5-task difference)
**Impact:** Data accuracy concern
**Location:** Homepage stats section
**Recommendation:** Verify task count query and ensure it matches expected values
**Priority:** **HIGH - IMPORTANT**

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Check query filtering (cohort, excluded tasks)
2. Verify `tasks` table count with `WHERE cohort = 'September 2025'`
3. Compare with documentation baseline (112 tasks expected)

---

### 🟡 P2: Inconsistent Day Count
**Issue:** Homepage shows "19 days" but Query page shows "18 days"
**Impact:** Inconsistent data display across pages
**Location:** Homepage vs `/query` page
**Recommendation:** Ensure consistent data source and display logic across all pages
**Priority:** **HIGH - IMPORTANT**

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Check if both pages use same query/calculation
2. Verify `curriculum_days` table count
3. Ensure consistent filtering (Thu/Fri exclusion)

---

## UX/UI Improvements (Nice to Have)

### 🟢 P3: Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Make "Best for:" labels more prominent** - These helpful indicators could be slightly larger or bolder
2. **Add subtle loading indicators** - For transitions that take >500ms, consider adding a subtle loader
3. **Consider adding tooltips/help icons** - For first-time users who might need more context

---

## Strengths

✅ **Excellent visual design** - Professional, clean, modern interface
✅ **Clear information architecture** - Easy to understand purpose and navigate
✅ **Responsive design works well** - Adapts properly to different screen sizes
✅ **Fast loading times** - All pages load quickly (<2s)
✅ **Consistent navigation** - Easy to move between sections
✅ **Well-organized content** - Both main interfaces are logical and intuitive
✅ **Good use of examples** - Pre-loaded queries help users understand capabilities
✅ **Helpful terminology section** - Supports user understanding

## Overall Scores

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Functionality** | 3.5/5 | Critical day detection bug, data discrepancies |
| **UX/UI** | 5/5 | Excellent design, clarity, and usability |
| **Performance** | 5/5 | Fast loading, smooth transitions |
| **Data Accuracy** | 2/5 | Multiple critical data issues |
| **Overall** | 4/5 | Would be 5/5 without critical bugs |

## Ready for Next Test?

❌ **No, critical issues must be fixed first**

**Reason:** The incorrect day detection (showing Thursday when it's Saturday) is a critical bug that fundamentally breaks the contextual messaging feature. Additionally, the data inconsistencies (task counts and day counts) need to be investigated and resolved to ensure data accuracy throughout the application. These issues should be addressed before proceeding to test the Natural Language Interface functionality.

---

## Recommended Actions Before Proceeding

**Immediate (Critical):**
1. ✅ Fix day-of-week detection logic
2. ✅ Add unit tests for date/day logic
3. ✅ Test with different days of the week

**High Priority:**
4. ✅ Investigate and resolve task count discrepancy (107 vs 112)
5. ✅ Ensure consistent "days" count across all pages (18 vs 19)
6. ✅ Verify data source consistency across application

**Before Production:**
7. ✅ Run full regression test after fixes
8. ✅ Verify all data points match expected baselines
9. ✅ Test timezone handling across different timezones

---

## Next Steps

Once the critical issues are resolved:
1. Re-test Guide 01 to verify fixes
2. Proceed to **Testing Guide 02: Natural Language Interface**
3. Continue systematic testing through all 8 guides

---

**Testing Status:** 🔴 BLOCKED - Critical issues must be resolved
**Recommendation:** Fix P1 and P2 issues before Wednesday presentation
