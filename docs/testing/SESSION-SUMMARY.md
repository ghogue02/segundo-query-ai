- [ ] Test all features work on mobile

### Priority 2 (Launch Week 1):
- [✅] Quality chart fallback - DONE
- [✅] Countdown timer - DONE
- [✅] Loading indicators - EXISTS
- [ ] Date labels in time ranges (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Tooltips for criteria (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Filter count badges (3-4 hours)

### Total Remaining Effort: 14-24 hours

## 📈 Score Trajectory

**Test 03 Scores:**
- Initial (estimated): Would have been 4.8/5 with grade inflation
- Critical Testing: 3.85/5 (realistic)
- After P1+P2 fixes: 4.5/5 (production ready)

**System Readiness:**
- Current: NOT READY (critical issues)
- After fixes: READY FOR PRODUCTION

## 💡 Key Insights from This Session

### 1. Critical Testing Works
Traditional testing would have given everything 5/5 and missed:
- Broken Quality chart
- Confusing filter UX
- Mobile usability risks

Critical testing found 27 real issues that need fixing.

### 2. Data Accuracy is Paramount
- Hardcoded stats (76/19/107) were wrong
- Dynamic stats (76/21/128) are correct
- Database verification is essential

### 3. UX Issues Matter as Much as Bugs
- Countdown timer isn't a "bug" but its absence hurts UX
- Filter count badges aren't required but significantly improve usability
- Tooltips prevent user confusion

### 4. Testing Documentation Quality Matters
- v1.0 guides would miss issues
- v2.0 critical guides find 5-10 issues per test
- Explicit AI instructions enable rigorous testing

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today):
- ✅ Session summary complete
- [ ] Quick wins: Date labels (1hr) + Basic tooltips (2hrs)
- [ ] Continue Test 04 with same critical approach

### This Week:
- [ ] Complete remaining P2 fixes (count badges)
- [ ] Mobile responsive testing and fixes
- [ ] Complete Tests 04-08
- [ ] Final regression testing

### Production Timeline:
- **Optimistic:** 3 days (if mobile works well)
- **Realistic:** 5 days (mobile needs fixes)
- **Pessimistic:** 7-10 days (significant mobile rework)
