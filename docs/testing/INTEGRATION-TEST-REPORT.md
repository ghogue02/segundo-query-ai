## Part 1: Integration Testing

### Objective
Verify TEAM 1 (Data Accuracy) and TEAM 2 (Accessibility/UX) fixes work together without conflicts.

---

### Test 1.1: Data Accuracy Verification

**Test Case:** Quality by Category Drill-Down Shows Unique Builder Scores

**TEAM 1 Changes Tested:**
- Individual builder rubric scores from BigQuery (`lib/services/bigquery-individual.ts`)
- Quality API returns actual builder data (`app/api/metrics/quality/route.ts`)
- Drill-down modal displays unique scores per builder

**TEAM 2 Changes Tested:**
- Modal accessibility (ARIA labels, focus trap)
- Keyboard navigation to open drill-down
- Screen reader announcements

**Test Execution:**
```bash
# Automated API test executed
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/api/metrics/quality?cohort=September%202025"
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/api/metrics/drill-down/quality-rubric?cohort=September%202025"
```

**Test Results:** 🟡 PARTIALLY PASSED

**✅ What Worked:**
1. **Individual Builder Scores Retrieved:** 61 builders returned with UNIQUE `overall_score` values
   - Range: 17 - 62 points
   - Variance confirmed (not all identical like before)
   - Example: Haoxin Wang (62), Brian Williams (60), Erika Medina (58)

2. **Builder Count Correct:** 61 builders in drill-down (out of 76 total)
   - 15 builders likely have no assessments yet
   - Acceptable for current cohort stage

3. **Overall Scores Display:** Each builder shows different overall assessment quality

**❌ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND:**

### 🚨 Issue #1: Rubric Category Breakdown Shows All Zeros

**Severity:** HIGH (Blocks one of TEAM 1's primary objectives)

**Description:**
All rubric category scores show as `0` for all 61 builders:
```json
{
  "user_id": 321,
  "builder_name": "Haoxin Wang",
  "overall_score": 62,  // ✅ Has value
  "technical_skills": 0,  // ❌ All zeros
  "business_value": 0,
  "project_mgmt": 0,
  "critical_thinking": 0,
  "professional_skills": 0,
  "assessments_count": 6
}
```

**Impact:**
- Quality radar chart will show flat line (all categories = 0)
- Original problem NOT fully resolved (still no category variance)
- Drill-down table shows incomplete information
- Users cannot see category-specific strengths/weaknesses

**Root Cause (Hypothesis):**
Based on TEAM 1's implementation report (`docs/PHASE1_DATA_ACCURACY_FIXES.md`), the issue is likely in:
1. **BigQuery Data Parsing:** `lib/services/bigquery-individual.ts` may not be correctly extracting `section_breakdown` and `rubric_scores` from `type_specific_data` JSON field
2. **JSON Structure:** The `type_specific_data` field may not contain the expected nested structure
3. **Field Mapping:** The SQL query may not be selecting the right fields or aggregating correctly

**Evidence:**
Quality API also returns placeholder data:
```json
{
  "avgScore": 36,
  "rubricBreakdown": [
    {"category": "Technical Skills", "score": 0, "note": "Data not yet available"},
    {"category": "Business Value", "score": 0, "note": "Data not yet available"},
    {"category": "Professional Skills", "score": 0, "note": "Data not yet available"}
  ],
  "note": "Category breakdown not yet available from BigQuery assessments"
}
```

**Recommendation:**
1. Investigate `comprehensive_assessment_analysis` table structure in BigQuery
2. Verify `type_specific_data` JSON format and contents
3. Debug `lib/services/bigquery-individual.ts` to ensure proper JSON parsing
4. Add fallback to use `rubric_scores` field if `section_breakdown` is empty
5. Add logging to trace which builders have valid category data

**Test Status:**
- ✅ Unique overall scores: PASS
- ❌ Category breakdown variance: FAIL (all zeros)
- 🟡 Integration with TEAM 2: PARTIAL (modal works, data incomplete)

---

### Test 1.2: Attendance Accuracy Verification

**Test Case:** NO Builder Shows >100% Attendance

**TEAM 1 Changes Tested:**
- Attendance calculation excludes Thu/Fri (`app/builder/[id]/page.tsx`)
- `LEAST()` function caps attendance at 100%
- `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` deduplicates same-day check-ins
- H1 chart uses same logic (`app/api/metrics/hypotheses/h1/route.ts`)

**TEAM 2 Changes Tested:**
- Builder profile page accessibility
- Keyboard navigation to builder profiles

**Test Execution Plan:**
```
1. Open /metrics dashboard
2. Click "Attendance Today" or "Attendance Rate" card
3. Click on individual builder from drill-down table
4. Navigate to builder profile page
5. Verify attendance shows ≤100% (e.g., "18/20 days = 90%")
6. Repeat for 10 random builders
7. Cross-check H1 hypothesis chart for same builders
8. Verify no data points exceed 100% on scatter plot
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All builders show attendance ≤100%
- ✅ Denominator excludes Thursday/Friday (only class days counted)
- ✅ No impossible ratios like 20/19 days
- ✅ H1 chart matches builder profile attendance
- ✅ Keyboard navigation works throughout

**Test Results:** 🔴 NOT YET TESTED

**Issues Found:**
- _None yet - testing not started_

### Test 1.3: Task Completion Consistency

**Test Case:** Task Completion is IDENTICAL Across All Features

**TEAM 1 Changes Tested:**
- Shared utility (`lib/metrics/task-completion.ts`)
- All features use same calculation:
  - Natural Language query
  - Dashboard KPI card
  - H1 hypothesis chart
  - Individual builder profile

**TEAM 2 Changes Tested:**
- Task completion KPI card accessibility
- Tooltips explain metric accurately

**Test Execution Plan:**
```
1. Select random builder (e.g., Builder ID: 42)
2. Query via Natural Language: "show task completion for builder 42"
3. Note completion percentage from NL response
4. Navigate to /metrics dashboard
5. Click "Task Completion" KPI card
6. Find Builder 42 in drill-down table, note percentage
7. Navigate to H1 hypothesis chart
8. Locate Builder 42 data point, note completion value
9. Click through to Builder 42 profile page
10. Note task completion percentage on profile
11. Compare all 4 values - MUST be identical (0% variance)
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ NL Query: 72%
- ✅ Dashboard KPI: 72%
- ✅ H1 Chart: 72%
- ✅ Builder Profile: 72%
- ✅ 0% variance across all methods
- ✅ Tooltip explains calculation method clearly

- Enter/Space keys open drill-downs
- Focus indicators visible (blue 2px ring)
- Focus trap in modals
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements

**Integration with TEAM 1:**
- Keyboard navigation works with new data endpoints
- Modal data loads correctly when opened via keyboard

**Test Execution Plan:**
```
1. Unplug mouse (keyboard-only navigation)
2. Navigate to /metrics using Tab key
3. Tab to first KPI card ("Attendance Today")
4. Verify blue focus ring is visible
5. Press Enter to open drill-down modal
6. Verify modal opens and focus moves to first element

8. Press ESC to close modal
9. Verify focus returns to "Attendance Today" card
10. Repeat for all 5 KPI cards
11. Test all drill-down tables load data correctly
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All 5 KPI cards in tab order
- ✅ Focus ring visible (blue, 2px)
- ✅ Enter/Space keys open modals
- ✅ Tab trapped within modal (no focus escape)
- ✅ ESC closes modal
- ✅ Focus restored to trigger card on close
