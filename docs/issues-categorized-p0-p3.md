**Generated:** October 4, 2025
**Source:** Testing Feedback Document (Tests 4-8)
**Total Issues:** 56

## CRITICAL (P0) - Must Fix Before Production

### ðŸš¨ Data Accuracy & Privacy

**ISSUE #1: Excluded Builders Fully Accessible (CRITICAL SECURITY/PRIVACY VIOLATION)**
- **Location:** Builder Profiles (Test 6.2)
- **Current Behavior:** Staff members (IDs: 129, 5, 240, 326) and duplicate accounts (ID: 324) have fully accessible profiles
- **Expected Behavior:** Should return 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found
- **Impact:** Exposes private data for individuals who should not appear in system
- **Suggested Fix:** Implement access control layer to block excluded user IDs before profile query
- **Test Plan:** Verify /builder/129, /builder/5, /builder/324 return errors

**ISSUE #2: Attendance Calculation Shows >100% (MATHEMATICAL IMPOSSIBILITY)**
- **Location:** Builder Profiles (Test 6.4, 6.6)
- **Current Behavior:** Builder 241 shows "20/19 days attended" = 105.3%
- **Expected Behavior:** Attendance should never exceed 100%
- **Impact:** Undermines trust in entire analytics platform
- **Suggested Fix:** Review curriculum_days query - ensure denominator counts only valid class days for date range
- **Test Plan:** Verify all builders show attendance â‰¤ 100%

**ISSUE #3: Quality by Category Shows Identical Scores for All Builders**
- **Location:** Quality Metrics Dashboard - Quality by Category Card (Test 5.2)
- **Current Behavior:** All 50 builders show identical scores (Overall: 36, Technical: 82, Business: 75, PM: 80, Critical: 72)
- **Expected Behavior:** Each builder should have individualized scores from BigQuery assessments
- **Impact:** Completely defeats purpose of individual quality tracking - instructors cannot identify who needs help
- **Suggested Fix:** Change query from `AVG(score) OVER()` to `AVG(score) GROUP BY builder_name`
- **Root Cause:** Query returns cohort averages instead of individual scores
- **Priority:** URGENT - Blocks individual builder quality tracking

## HIGH (P1) - Fix Before Launch

### ðŸ”´ Navigation & Functionality

**ISSUE #4: "Back to Dashboard" Button Non-Functional**
- **Location:** Builder Profiles (Test 6.9)
- **Current Behavior:** Button visible but clicking has no effect
- **Expected Behavior:** Should navigate back to /metrics dashboard
- **Impact:** Users forced to use browser back button
- **Suggested Fix:** Add onClick handler with router.push('/metrics')

**ISSUE #5: KPI Cards Not Keyboard Accessible**
- **Location:** Metrics Dashboard - All KPI Cards (Test 4.1-4.5, 4.8)
- **Current Behavior:** Cards have no tab order, cannot activate with Enter/Space
- **Expected Behavior:** Cards should be in tab order with role="button"
- **Impact:** WCAG 2.1 Level A violation - keyboard users cannot access drill-downs
- **Suggested Fix:** Add `tabindex="0"`, `role="button"`, `onKeyDown` handlers to all KPI cards
- **Accessibility Score:** CRITICAL

**ISSUE #6: Missing ARIA Labels on KPI Cards and Modals**
- **Location:** Metrics Dashboard (Test 4.1-4.5)
- **Current Behavior:** No aria-label, role="dialog", or aria-modal attributes
- **Expected Behavior:** Proper ARIA semantics for screen readers
- **Impact:** Screen readers cannot announce cards/modals properly
- **Suggested Fix:**
  - Cards: Add `aria-label="Attendance Today: 49 out of 76 builders present. Click to view details"`
  - Modals: Add `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`

**ISSUE #7: No Visible Hover States on KPI Cards**
- **Location:** Metrics Dashboard - All KPI Cards (Test 4.8)
- **Current Behavior:** Only cursor changes to pointer, no visual effect
- **Expected Behavior:** Background color change, border highlight, or shadow increase on hover
- **Impact:** Poor affordance - users may not realize cards are clickable
- **Suggested Fix:** Add CSS hover state with `transform: translateY(-2px)` and `box-shadow` increase

### ðŸ”´ Data Accuracy

**ISSUE #8: Task Completion Variance Between Features (3% Discrepancy)**
- **Location:** H1 Chart vs Builder Profile (Test 8.6)
- **Current Behavior:** H1 chart shows 75%, profile shows 72% for same builder (Michael Fehdrau)
- **Expected Behavior:** Both should show identical value
- **Impact:** Users see conflicting data across features
- **Suggested Fix:** Ensure both features query same data source with identical calculation

**ISSUE #9: Builder Name Mismatch on Navigation**
- **Location:** Metrics Dashboard â†’ Builder Profile (Test 6.1)
- **Current Behavior:** Clicked "Kane Roman" but profile shows "Farla Noman" at URL /builder/271
- **Expected Behavior:** Profile should show clicked builder's name
- **Impact:** Confusing user experience, possible data integrity issue
- **Suggested Fix:** Verify builder_id mapping in attendance drill-down query

### ðŸ”´ UX/Content Issues

**ISSUE #10: Typo on "Need Intervention" Card**
- **Location:** Metrics Dashboard - Need Intervention KPI Card (Test 4.5)
- **Current Behavior:** Card shows "30% completion OR <70% attendance"
- **Expected Behavior:** Should be "<50% completion OR <70% attendance"
- **Impact:** Misleading information about intervention criteria

**ISSUE #12: Missing Standalone "Engagement Score" Definition**
- **Location:** Terminology Legend (Test 7.8)
- **Current Behavior:** Formula only appears embedded in other definitions
- **Expected Behavior:** Dedicated "Engagement Score" section

**ISSUE #13: No Loading States on KPI Cards**
- **Location:** Metrics Dashboard (Test 4.9)
- **Current Behavior:** No skeleton, spinner, or loading indicator during data refresh

**ISSUE #17: Confusing Comparison Metrics**
- **Location:** Attendance Today KPI (Test 4.6)
- **Current Behavior:** Shows "â†‘ 22% vs 7-day avg" but today's rate (64.5%) < 7-day rate (71%)
- **Expected Behavior:** Comparison should be logical
- **Impact:** Contradictory or unclear metrics
- **Suggested Fix:** Clarify what 22% represents (absolute change? relative change?)

**ISSUE #18: Natural Language "Key Insights" Discrepancy**
- **Location:** Natural Language Query Results (Test 8.1)
- **Current Behavior:** Summary says "10 individuals absent" but table shows 27 rows
- **Expected Behavior:** Summary should match row count
- **Impact:** Confusing summary doesn't match data
- **Suggested Fix:** Update AI summary generation to count actual query results

**ISSUE #19: Quality Score Appears Identical for Multiple Builders (36/100)**
- **Location:** Builder Profiles (Test 6.4)
- **Current Behavior:** Multiple builders tested all show Quality Score = 36
- **Expected Behavior:** Individualized scores
- **Impact:** May not be personalized

- **Impact:** Users cannot access underlying data
- **Suggested Fix:** Populate drill-down with weekly data

**ISSUE #21: H5 Completion Rate Labels Are Confusing**
- **Location:** Quality Metrics - H5 Weekend Patterns (Test 5.7)
- **Current Behavior:** Shows "2% completion rate" but Y-axis is "Number of Submissions"
- **Expected Behavior:** Consistent units (either counts OR percentages)
- **Impact:** Users confused about metric meaning
- **Suggested Fix:** Use "90 weekday submissions, 190 weekend submissions" OR "32% weekday, 68% weekend"

**ISSUE #22: H4 Insight Contradicts Chart Data**
- **Location:** H4 Week-over-Week Chart (Test 5.6)
- **Current Behavior:** Insight says "stable" but chart shows fluctuations
- **Expected Behavior:** Insight should match visual trend
- **Impact:** Misleading interpretation
- **Suggested Fix:** Update to "Performance fluctuates week-over-week. Week 3 peak followed by decline."

**ISSUE #23: No Contextual Messages for No-Class Days**
- **Location:** Attendance Prior Day KPI (Test 4.2)
- **Current Behavior:** Thursday/Friday show "0/76" without explanation
- **Expected Behavior:** Badge or message "No class scheduled on Thursday"
- **Impact:** Users may think low attendance vs understanding "no class"
- **Suggested Fix:** Replace decline % with "No class scheduled" on Thu/Fri

**ISSUE #24: Late Arrival Time Not Shown in Builder Profiles**
- **Location:** Builder Profile - Attendance History (Test 6.5)
- **Current Behavior:** Only shows "late" badge, no minute count
