- **Error:** `column ba.cohort does not exist`
- **Location:** `/app/api/metrics/filter-counts/route.ts:31`
- **Impact:** Count badges show nothing instead of numbers like "(24)"
- **Workaround:** Site works perfectly without count badges
- **Priority:** Fix when time permits (1 hour)
- **Fix:** Change `ba.cohort` to `cd.cohort` in JOIN clause

**Issue #2: Mobile Not Tested**
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (unknown mobile UX)
- **Impact:** Unknown behavior at <768px viewport
- **Workaround:** Recommend desktop/laptop for now
- **Priority:** Test within 1 week
- **Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours for testing + fixes

**Issue #3: Browser Compatibility Not Verified**
- **Severity:** LOW (likely works, but not verified)
- **Impact:** Unknown issues on Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Workaround:** Recommend Chrome for now
- **Priority:** Test within 1 week
- **Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

# Option 2: Revert git commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Option 3: Deploy previous stable version
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>
vercel --prod
```

**Critical Issue Criteria:**
