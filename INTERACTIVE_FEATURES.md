## 🔄 User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Task Analysis
```
User asks: "which tasks have low completion rates?"
  → Table shows tasks with completion %
  → Click on "Weekly Feedback" task
  → Panel opens with 17.28% completion rate
  → See list of 14 builders who completed it
  → Click on specific builder
  → Builder panel opens showing their full profile
```

### Workflow 2: Builder Investigation
```
User asks: "show me top performers"
  → Table shows builders ranked by engagement
  → Click on "Joshua Viera" (80.09%)
  → Panel shows his complete profile
  → See he has 100% attendance but 47% punctuality
  → See his 96 completed tasks listed
  → Click on specific task he completed
  → Task panel opens with details
```

### Workflow 3: Direct Links
```
Team member shares: localhost:3000/?builder=295
  → Page loads with Joshua's profile open
  → No need to run query first
  → Can explore from there
```

## 📈 Performance

### API Response Times (Tested):
- Task details: ~50-200ms
- Builder profile: ~100-300ms (more data)
- Parallel loading: All queries run simultaneously

### Database Query Optimization:
- ✅ Used indexed columns (user_id, task_id)
- ✅ Filtered early with WHERE clauses
- ✅ Used DISTINCT ON for deduplication
- ✅ Parallel fetch with Promise.all()

---

## 🐛 Issues Fixed During Implementation

### Issue #1: Task Completion Count Wrong
**Problem**: Initially showed 0 completed when there were 76 threads

**Fix**: Changed from filtering IN subquery to JOINing users properly:
```sql
-- Before (wrong)
COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ts.user_id IN (...) THEN ... END)

-- After (correct)
LEFT JOIN users u ON (ts.user_id = u.user_id OR tt.user_id = u.user_id)
COUNT(DISTINCT u.user_id)
```

### Issue #2: ORDER BY Error in Tasks Query
**Problem**: "ORDER BY expressions must appear in select list"

**Fix**: Used `SELECT DISTINCT ON` instead of `SELECT DISTINCT`:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ON (t.id)
  t.id, t.task_title, cd.day_number, tb.start_time
ORDER BY t.id, cd.day_number, tb.start_time
```
