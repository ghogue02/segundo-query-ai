# Task Completion Drop-Off Analysis

## üìâ **Confirmed: Real Drop-Off Pattern Identified**

### Average Completion Rate by Day:

| Days | Date Range | Avg Completion | Status |
|------|------------|---------------|--------|
| **1-7** (Week 1-2) | Sept 6-17 | **83-90%** | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| **8-13** (Week 2-3) | Sept 16-24 | **60-77%** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Declining |
| **14-17** (Week 3-4) | Sept 24-29 | **52-71%** | üî¥ Concerning |

### Critical Days:
- **Day 14** (Sept 24): 52.38% average - **LOWEST**
- **Day 17** (Sept 29): 55.33% average - Still low
- **Day 9** (Sept 17): 60.19% average - Start of decline

## üîç **Detailed Findings:**

### Day 14 (Sept 24) - Most Problematic:
| Task | Completion |
|------|------------|
| Daily Stand-up | 56/75 (74.67%) |
| Final Build Prep | 51/75 (68.00%) |
| Presentation Prep | 48/75 (64.00%) |
| Final Build Session | 44/75 (58.67%) |
| Group Retrospective | 33/75 (44.00%) |
| Independent Retro | 30/75 (40.00%) |
| **Weekly Feedback** | **13/75 (17.33%)** ‚ö†Ô∏è |

**Weekly Feedback** on Day 14 has critically low completion!

### Day 11 (Sept 21) - Also Problematic:
| Task | Completion |
|------|------------|
| Headline of the Week | 61/75 (81.33%) |
| Daily Stand-up | 61/75 (81.33%) |
| Problem Statements | 60/75 (80.00%) |
| Ideation and Scoping | 57/75 (76.00%) |
| Code and Coffee | 47/75 (62.67%) |
| Lunch Break | 33/75 (44.00%) |
| Independent Retro | **31/75 (41.33%)** üî¥ |

**Independent Retrospective** shows declining completion over time.

## üí° **Possible Causes:**

### 1. **Recency Effect** (Most Likely)
- **Day 17** (Sept 29) is very recent/current day
- Builders haven't finished all tasks yet
- As time passes, completion will increase
- **Action**: Monitor over next few days

### 2. **Task Type Patterns**
**Build Time tasks** consistently show lower completion:
- Day 12 Build Time: 55/75 (73.33%)
- Day 13 Build Time: 53/75 (70.67%)
- Day 17 Build Time: 36/75 (48.00%) üî¥

**Reason**: Build Time = independent coding work
- May not create formal threads/submissions
- Completion tracking might not capture "working but not chatting"

### 3. **Retrospective Fatigue**
**Independent Retrospective** declining from 89% ‚Üí 31%:
- Day 1: 67/75 (89.33%)
- Day 2: 60/75 (80.00%)
- Day 11: 31/75 (41.33%)
- Day 17: 23/75 (30.67%)

**Reason**: Daily reflection task may feel repetitive
- Builders might skip as they get comfortable
- Less conversational (basic mode, no AI)

### 4. **Weekly Feedback Forms**
**Weekly Feedback** shows VERY low completion:
- Day 14: 13/75 (17.33%) üî¥
- Day 9: No data shown
- Day 5: No data shown

**Critical Question**: Are these feedback tasks marked correctly?
- Should have `feedback_slot: true` in task object
- Only appear on certain days
- May not be tracked the same way

---

## ‚ùì **Questions for Clarification:**

### Q1: Build Time Tracking
**Build Time** tasks show 48-73% completion. Is this accurate?

**Possible issue**: Build Time is independent coding without AI chat.
- If builders are coding but not chatting, no `task_threads` created
- No formal submissions expected for build time
- **Are we undercounting actual work?**

**Need to know**: How should we track Build Time completion?

---

### Q2: Weekly Feedback Forms
**Weekly Feedback** on Day 14 shows only 17.33% (13/75 builders).

**Questions**:
- Is this a real concern or expected?
- Do all 75 builders receive feedback form?
- Is there a separate tracking mechanism?
- Should we query `builder_feedback` table instead?

**Data check**: Earlier query showed feedback records exist

---

### Q3: Independent Retrospective Decline
**Pattern**: 89% ‚Üí 80% ‚Üí 41% ‚Üí 31%

**Is this**:
- **A)** Real drop-off requiring intervention
- **B)** Expected as builders get more independent
- **C)** Tracking issue (maybe some don't create threads for retros)

---

### Q4: Recency Bias
**Days 14-17** are Sept 24-29 (very recent).

**Question**: What is today's date?
- If today is Sept 29 or 30, Day 17 tasks might still be in progress
- Should we exclude last 2-3 days from "low completion" alerts?

---

## üéØ **Recommended Actions:**

### Immediate (Data Validation):
1. ‚úÖ **Verify Weekly Feedback tracking**
   - Check `builder_feedback` table directly
   - Compare with task_threads count
   - Ensure feedback_slot tasks are tracked correctly

2. ‚úÖ **Audit Build Time tracking**
   - Determine if build work is being captured
   - Consider alternative completion indicators
   - May need to ask builders directly

3. ‚úÖ **Check recency effect**
   - Identify "current" vs "past" days
   - Filter out last 2 days from completion analysis
   - Monitor day-by-day completion growth

### Strategic (Program Improvement):
1. **Address Retrospective fatigue**
   - Day 1: 89% ‚Üí Day 17: 31%
   - Make retros more varied/engaging
   - Consider alternating formats

2. **Investigate Day 9 & Day 14 drops**
   - Day 9: 60.19% average (start of decline)
   - Day 14: 52.38% average (lowest point)
   - What happened on these days?

3. **Monitor "Build Time" effectiveness**
   - Completion tracking may not reflect actual work
   - Consider check-ins during build sessions

## üìä **Summary Findings:**

**Drop-off is REAL but has multiple causes**:
- ‚úÖ Confirmed: Completion declining from 89% to 55% over time
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Likely: Recent days (14-17) haven't had time to complete
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible: Build Time tracking incomplete
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible: Retrospective fatigue setting in
- üî¥ Critical: Weekly Feedback on Day 14 only 17.33%!

**Need Your Input**:
1. What is today's date? (to assess recency effect)
2. How should Build Time be tracked? (independent work)
3. Is 17.33% feedback completion normal or concerning?
4. Should Independent Retrospective be daily? (builders tiring of it)

## ‚úÖ **Next Steps:**

I've identified the pattern and possible causes. Please advise on the questions above so I can:
1. Refine completion tracking logic
2. Update AI to account for recency/task types
3. Alert on REAL issues vs expected patterns

**Interactive features are complete and working!** Ready for your feedback on the drop-off analysis.
