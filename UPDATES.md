# Updates Applied - September 30, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Input Text Color
**Problem**: Text in input box was hard to read
**Solution**: Applied `text-gray-900` class for black text, `placeholder:text-gray-400` for gray placeholders

**File**: `components/QueryChat.tsx:77`

---

### 2. ✅ Conversational AI Experience
**Problem**: AI generated queries immediately without asking for clarification
**Solution**:
- Added conversational logic to ask follow-up questions for ambiguous queries
- Maintains conversation history across interactions
- Examples of clarifications:
  - "show me task completion" → Asks for: by builder, by type, or overall?
  - "attendance" → Asks for: today, trend, or specific dates?

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/claude.ts` - Added `needsClarification` logic
- `components/QueryChat.tsx` - Added conversation state and UI for clarifications
- `app/api/query/route.ts` - Handle clarification responses

---

### 3. ✅ September 2025 Cohort Filter Enforcement
**Problem**: Queries were pulling data from all cohorts (March, June, September 2025)
**Solution**:
- **Enhanced database schema** with CRITICAL COHORT FILTERING RULES section
- **Mandatory filters** for all tables:
  - `users`: `WHERE cohort = 'September 2025'`
  - `curriculum_days`: `WHERE cohort = 'September 2025'`
  - All related tables: JOIN to users/curriculum_days to inherit filter
- **Validation checklist** in AI prompt to verify cohort filters before generating SQL
- **Emphasized in system prompt** with multiple warnings about cohort filtering

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/claude.ts:12-68` - Enhanced schema with cohort filter requirements
- `lib/claude.ts:89-130` - Added validation checklist and requirements

**Example SQL that will now be generated**:
```sql
-- Before (WRONG - pulls all cohorts)
SELECT u.first_name, COUNT(utp.id)
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN user_task_progress utp ON u.user_id = utp.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id;

-- After (CORRECT - September 2025 only)
SELECT u.first_name, COUNT(utp.id)
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN user_task_progress utp ON u.user_id = utp.user_id
WHERE u.cohort = 'September 2025'
  AND u.user_id NOT IN (129, 5, 240, 324, 325, 326, 9)
  AND u.active = true
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.first_name
LIMIT 20;
```

## Technical Details

### New Features

**Conversation State Management**:
```typescript
const [conversationHistory, setConversationHistory] = useState<Array<{role: string, content: string}>>([]);
const [needsClarification, setNeedsClarification] = useState(false);
const [clarificationQuestion, setClarificationQuestion] = useState('');
```

**AI Response Types**:
```typescript
// Clarification needed
{
  "needsClarification": true,
  "clarificationQuestion": "Would you like to see task completion by individual builder, by task type, or overall completion rate?"
}

// Query ready
{
  "needsClarification": false,
  "sql": "SELECT...",
  "explanation": "...",
  "chartType": "bar",
  ...
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Input text is visible (black color)
- [x] Placeholder text is gray
- [ ] AI asks clarification for "show me task completion"
- [ ] AI asks clarification for vague time references
- [ ] All queries filter by September 2025 cohort
- [ ] No March 2025 or June 2025 data appears in results
- [ ] Excluded user IDs (129, 5, 240, 324, 325, 326, 9) are not in results

---

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Test clarification flow**:
   - Ask: "show me task completion"
   - Verify AI asks follow-up
   - Provide clarification: "by individual builder"
   - Verify query executes correctly

2. **Verify cohort filtering**:
   - Ask: "show me all users"
   - Check SQL includes: `WHERE cohort = 'September 2025'`
   - Verify results show only September 2025 builders

3. **Test various queries**:
   - "What's today's attendance?"
   - "Show me task completion trends"
   - "Who are the top performers?"
   - All should filter to September 2025 only
