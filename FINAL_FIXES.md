# Final UI/UX Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Show All Button for Attendance Timeline
**Issue**: Attendance timeline only showed recent 10 of 16+ records

**Fix**: Added "Show All X Days" button
- Shows recent 10 by default
- Click button to expand to all records
- Click again to collapse back to 10
- Green button to match attendance theme

**File**: `components/detail-panels/BuilderDetailPanel.tsx:245-253`

---

### 2. ✅ Show All Button for Completed Tasks
**Issue**: Task list only showed recent 15 of 101+ tasks

**Fix**: Added "Show All X Tasks" button
- Shows recent 15 by default
- Click button to expand to all tasks
- Click again to collapse back to 15
- Blue button to match tasks theme

**File**: `components/detail-panels/BuilderDetailPanel.tsx:281-289`

---

### 3. ✅ Task Click Handler in Builder Profile
**Issue**: Clicking tasks in builder profile didn't open task detail panel

**Fix**: Enhanced click handler with proper event handling
```typescript
onClick={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation();
  console.log('Clicking task:', task.task_id, task.task_title);
  onTaskClick?.(task.task_id);
}}
```

**File**: `components/detail-panels/BuilderDetailPanel.tsx:269-275`

**Result**:
- Click "Value Propositions" in builder profile
- Task detail panel opens
- Cross-navigation now works both ways!

---

### 4. ✅ Show All Button in Main Query Results
**Issue**: Query results limited to 50 rows with no way to expand

**Fix**: Added expandable table with toggle button
- Shows 50 rows by default
- "Show All 81 Rows" button appears
- Click to expand/collapse
- Blue button with chevron icons

**File**: `components/ChartRenderer.tsx:113, 161-180`
