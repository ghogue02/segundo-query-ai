[{"sentence":"They've gotten a lot better at it.","startTime":"06:31","endTime":"06:32"},{"sentence":"Yeah, I do feel like this.","startTime":"06:32","endTime":"06:36"},{"sentence":"This cohort is more prepared from like, a lot of this kind of like fundamental stuff.","startTime":"06:37","endTime":"06:45"},{"sentence":"You can tell everything.","startTime":"06:46","endTime":"06:47"},{"sentence":"A lot of the thought in.","startTime":"06:48","endTime":"06:49"},{"sentence":"We've been forcing it and saying, okay, trust AI don't.","startTime":"06:49","endTime":"06:53"},{"sentence":"Trust AI don't tr.","startTime":"06:53","endTime":"06:54"},{"sentence":"That's where group workers come together.","startTime":"06:57","endTime":"07:00"},{"sentence":"They're fitting.","startTime":"07:05","endTime":"07:05"},{"sentence":"Hey, what's up, guys?","startTime":"07:19","endTime":"07:20"},{"sentence":"What up, guys?","startTime":"07:21","endTime":"07:21"},{"sentence":"All right, so this one's been cooking for a little bit.","startTime":"07:25","endTime":"07:28"},{"sentence":"Sounds like you both got a chance to at least test out theoretically what AI cohort analyzer could do.","startTime":"07:29","endTime":"07:41"},{"sentence":"What I've been observing in all these meetings is folks keep asking different questions and we don't really have answers for those questions.","startTime":"07:43","endTime":"07:52"},{"sentence":"So that in mind, I started just thinking, well, if they do something yesterday, well, just throw it through an LLM and see what happens and it should be able to do it.","startTime":"07:52","endTime":"08:01"},{"sentence":"And that's pretty much what I built, obviously.","startTime":"08:01","endTime":"08:05"},{"sentence":"Sort of keeping in mind, like, there's the operational components that we need every day and on a weekly basis and report on, but then there's also the stuff where it comes to like, okay, what insights and patterns are there that we can extract to just make the program better overall?","startTime":"08:05","endTime":"08:22"},{"sentence":"My goal was to get away from so many questions just being unanswered to being like, great, let's ask them and get the answers for.","startTime":"08:24","endTime":"08:31"},{"sentence":"So this is a prototype, but I need your all thoughts one its functionality versus what you all are also working on collectively.","startTime":"08:34","endTime":"08:42"},{"sentence":"If this is something that we should pursue, what do I need to do from a PRD perspective or continue developing it on my own and then pass it off to you all for conversion?","startTime":"08:44","endTime":"08:54"},{"sentence":"Don't really know the best steps from here.","startTime":"08:55","endTime":"08:58"},{"sentence":"You need to talk to Dave.","startTime":"08:58","endTime":"08:59"},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"09:01","endTime":"09:01"},{"sentence":"Thank you for sharing.","startTime":"09:01","endTime":"09:03"},{"sentence":"It's definitely a dream to have something like this.","startTime":"09:03","endTime":"09:06"},{"sentence":"I think the best thing that we should do, I mean, we can go through the whole PRV process and like get it slated.","startTime":"09:11","endTime":"09:20"},{"sentence":"But I think actually for something like this, like I kind of just said, like, we need to have real like metric definition sessions and like take the time to define how do we want these things started.","startTime":"09:20","endTime":"09:34"},{"sentence":"Maybe AI can take a first shot at a lot of those, but we need to validate because I was just talking about this with Tim too, because he's working on something similar.","startTime":"09:34","endTime":"09:43"},{"sentence":"The issue actually with the whole orgs data historically has been lack of trust, I think.","startTime":"09:44","endTime":"09:51"},{"sentence":"So I think we need to get everyone's mind that we've thought through the way that all these things are calculated and especially within Something that's generative, we need to be able to trust that it's correct.","startTime":"09:51","endTime":"10:05"},{"sentence":"So I think those sessions could be kind of painful, but, like, are very needed.","startTime":"10:06","endTime":"10:10"},{"sentence":"And then once we have all those definitions, there will be an exercise of, like, feeding that in validating that they're mapping it correctly to the fields and stuff and then doing some testing.","startTime":"10:12","endTime":"10:26"},{"sentence":"But I think, yeah, that's the hard part of it.","startTime":"10:26","endTime":"10:28"},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"10:29","endTime":"10:29"},{"sentence":"What do you think?","startTime":"10:29","endTime":"10:30"},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's the hard part.","startTime":"10:31","endTime":"10:32"},{"sentence":"But I feel like we continue to just kind of go in a loop there and never get anywhere, and that's just frustrating.","startTime":"10:32","endTime":"10:38"},{"sentence":"I'm sure you all experienced that, so I don't know what to do there.","startTime":"10:38","endTime":"10:44"},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"10:45","endTime":"10:45"},{"sentence":"I also am thinking, obviously this is part of what the future of data analytics is going to be, but I also think there is value in having things laid out in a visual and, like, a visual way that's, like, consistent, so you can get used to it, and then you can more like, effectively see outliers.","startTime":"10:46","endTime":"11:15"},{"sentence":"And I wonder in the future, I wonder if, like, combining this with a dashboard would be cool, where it's like, it's a static dashboard, but it automatically identifies outliers, or it's like, yeah, hybrid.","startTime":"11:15","endTime":"11:31"},{"sentence":"So that'd be cool.","startTime":"11:31","endTime":"11:32"},{"sentence":"I do think a third part of that is kind of proactive of, like, it already analyzed the data, it found these insights.","startTime":"11:33","endTime":"11:41"},{"sentence":"Here's what you should act on.","startTime":"11:41","endTime":"11:42"},{"sentence":"But go ahead and drill down if you want to run your own reports.","startTime":"11:42","endTime":"11:45"},{"sentence":"Here's like, the key KPIs that we all are focused on.","startTime":"11:45","endTime":"11:49"},{"sentence":"Yeah, I can definitely see that being so no matter what your flavor is, you can kind of find it and maybe like, back to the documentation thing.","startTime":"11:51","endTime":"11:58"},{"sentence":"Kind of good timing because they're doing QDRs, so we can see everything that Joanne is paying attention to.","startTime":"11:59","endTime":"12:06"},{"sentence":"We can write down everything that we go through every week in the lectures.","startTime":"12:06","endTime":"12:10"},{"sentence":"And then I think every time we build something new as part of launching that, it should be like, all right, what are the new KPIs that we need to find and feed to the.","startTime":"12:11","endTime":"12:19"},{"sentence":"So just like.","startTime":"12:21","endTime":"12:21"},{"sentence":"And then just having a legend of like, this is what we all agreed on.","startTime":"12:21","endTime":"12:24"},{"sentence":"Exactly.","startTime":"12:25","endTime":"12:25"},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"12:26","endTime":"12:26"},{"sentence":"Because it is confusing for the AI.","startTime":"12:26","endTime":"12:28"},{"sentence":"Notice, like, what a deliverable is with submission.","startTime":"12:28","endTime":"12:31"},{"sentence":"It's a text interaction.","startTime":"12:32","endTime":"12:33"},{"sentence":"It's like that simple, you know?","startTime":"12:33","endTime":"12:34"},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"12:35","endTime":"12:35"},{"sentence":"And then look for patterns there.","startTime":"12:35","endTime":"12:37"},{"sentence":"Do they do that?","startTime":"12:37","endTime":"12:38"},{"sentence":"Great.","startTime":"12:38","endTime":"12:38"},{"sentence":"I'll consider if they completed the task.","startTime":"12:38","endTime":"12:40"},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"12:40","endTime":"12:41"},{"sentence":"The depth of it is what is just the nuanced part.","startTime":"12:41","endTime":"12:44"},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"12:44","endTime":"12:44"},{"sentence":"Hey, guys.","startTime":"12:52","endTime":"12:52"},{"sentence":"Guys.","startTime":"12:57","endTime":"12:58"},{"sentence":"Right now.","startTime":"12:58","endTime":"12:58"},{"sentence":"And I just see so much data here.","startTime":"12:58","endTime":"13:00"},{"sentence":"It's like everything that we're trying to pull.","startTime":"13:00","endTime":"13:02"},{"sentence":"So my understanding is that it's just an AI that's hooked up to our database, which can then run complex queries based on the question is that it.","startTime":"13:02","endTime":"13:08"},{"sentence":"Formulates it into the proper query so that the database understands it.","startTime":"13:10","endTime":"13:15"},{"sentence":"Give me a second, I'll actually share my screen.","startTime":"13:16","endTime":"13:20"},{"sentence":"That was tricky.","startTime":"13:27","endTime":"13:28"},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think that's.","startTime":"13:28","endTime":"13:29"},{"sentence":"That was actually really tricky because then it has to append it to the original query and rerun it.","startTime":"13:29","endTime":"13:36"},{"sentence":"It's not perfect yet, but it is.","startTime":"13:36","endTime":"13:38"},{"sentence":"Getting Carl's is helpful.","startTime":"13:38","endTime":"13:46"},{"sentence":"Yeah, I like this.","startTime":"13:47","endTime":"13:48"},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"13:55","endTime":"13:55"},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"13:55","endTime":"13:56"},{"sentence":"But like, even before the user question, in the system flow, they have the schema, the context of the schema.","startTime":"13:56","endTime":"14:04"},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"14:04","endTime":"14:04"},{"sentence":"The AI does.","startTime":"14:05","endTime":"14:06"},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's a good question.","startTime":"14:06","endTime":"14:10"},{"sentence":"It was knowing what the schema is, but I don't know.","startTime":"14:13","endTime":"14:16"},{"sentence":"I don't answer to that.","startTime":"14:17","endTime":"14:18"},{"sentence":"There must be some logic in there where I can process against it in order to make the right query.","startTime":"14:21","endTime":"14:27"},{"sentence":"Because it must have the tables, so it must exist.","startTime":"14:27","endTime":"14:30"},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think so.","startTime":"14:30","endTime":"14:31"},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"14:32","endTime":"14:32"},{"sentence":"Maybe one of.","startTime":"14:32","endTime":"14:33"},{"sentence":"I think adding to that context further, like having schema, but also having maybe some, like, keyword mapping of.","startTime":"14:33","endTime":"14:38"},{"sentence":"When they say submissions, they mean, like, this field.","startTime":"14:39","endTime":"14:42"},{"sentence":"Things like that probably go one way.","startTime":"14:42","endTime":"14:44"},{"sentence":"Very cool, though.","startTime":"14:47","endTime":"14:48"},{"sentence":"But I think, like, a good MVP maybe would be to identify, like, the top 10 metrics that we track all the time and get those, like, really trustworthy and solid and, like, find them all together, make it work and then you can, like, slowly add to it.","startTime":"14:58","endTime":"15:16"},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"15:16","endTime":"15:17"},{"sentence":"But, yeah, that could be really cool.","startTime":"15:18","endTime":"15:21"},{"sentence":"Like things like attendance and grades and task submission shouldn't be that difficult.","startTime":"15:21","endTime":"15:26"},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"15:26","endTime":"15:26"},{"sentence":"Grades.","startTime":"15:28","endTime":"15:29"},{"sentence":"Yeah, they're there.","startTime":"15:29","endTime":"15:30"},{"sentence":"It's all about, like, how much we trust the grades.","startTime":"15:30","endTime":"15:32"},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"15:32","endTime":"15:33"},{"sentence":"And I think there's.","startTime":"15:33","endTime":"15:34"},{"sentence":"If we're talking yesterday, there's still, like, subtle nuances, kind of throw it off.","startTime":"15:35","endTime":"15:38"},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"15:39","endTime":"15:39"},{"sentence":"So I see, like, I see attendance here, but then completed tasks.","startTime":"15:42","endTime":"15:47"},{"sentence":"How are you judging what's completed versus not complete?","startTime":"15:47","endTime":"15:51"},{"sentence":"Was there any interaction with the task or not?","startTime":"15:52","endTime":"15:55"},{"sentence":"Very simple.","startTime":"15:55","endTime":"15:56"},{"sentence":"So it's not a quality check, it's just a interaction check.","startTime":"15:58","endTime":"16:02"},{"sentence":"Got it.","startTime":"16:02","endTime":"16:03"},{"sentence":"And I could scroll.","startTime":"16:07","endTime":"16:09"},{"sentence":"You should be able to click on a task and see if it opens up.","startTime":"16:09","endTime":"16:13"},{"sentence":"That one I was having trouble with.","startTime":"16:13","endTime":"16:15"},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"16:15","endTime":"16:15"},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"16:17","endTime":"16:18"},{"sentence":"We get here and then I think the next step is being able to click on the thread.","startTime":"16:18","endTime":"16:22"},{"sentence":"What happens when you click on.","startTime":"16:22","endTime":"16:23"},{"sentence":"Just takes me to the person, the next person.","startTime":"16:24","endTime":"16:27"},{"sentence":"I can see this part.","startTime":"16:29","endTime":"16:29"},{"sentence":"That's awesome.","startTime":"16:29","endTime":"16:30"},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"16:33","endTime":"16:33"},{"sentence":"So my experience with building data dashboards for several different types of operations.","startTime":"16:33","endTime":"16:42"},{"sentence":"The ability to drill down is always the follow up question for anyone.","startTime":"16:42","endTime":"16:49"},{"sentence":"Okay, I can see this.","startTime":"16:49","endTime":"16:50"},{"sentence":"What does this mean?","startTime":"16:50","endTime":"16:50"},{"sentence":"Yeah, okay, I see this now.","startTime":"16:51","endTime":"16:52"},{"sentence":"What does this mean?","startTime":"16:52","endTime":"16:53"},{"sentence":"Let me see the details.","startTime":"16:53","endTime":"16:54"},{"sentence":"And that's what I'm trying to accomplish here is like whatever you want to find out.","startTime":"16:54","endTime":"16:58"},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"16:59","endTime":"16:59"},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"16:59","endTime":"17:00"},{"sentence":"Yeah, this is great.","startTime":"17:07","endTime":"17:07"},{"sentence":"So do I need to build a PRD for this or should I just keep working on the prototype?","startTime":"17:09","endTime":"17:15"},{"sentence":"I do have to get Joanna signed off on, like the actual data outputs.","startTime":"17:16","endTime":"17:22"},{"sentence":"But what's best for you all?","startTime":"17:22","endTime":"17:24"},{"sentence":"I think that a simple PRV and then distorting the Wednesday meeting would be good.","startTime":"17:24","endTime":"17:29"},{"sentence":"Just like it's like the checkpoint to run it by Dave basically.","startTime":"17:29","endTime":"17:33"},{"sentence":"But then.","startTime":"17:36","endTime":"17:36"},{"sentence":"Yeah, we can do those afternoons.","startTime":"17:36","endTime":"17:40"},{"sentence":"Oh yeah.","startTime":"17:40","endTime":"17:41"},{"sentence":"I mean, we can also just do our own.","startTime":"17:41","endTime":"17:43"},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"17:43","endTime":"17:44"},{"sentence":"Once we have that's still the time.","startTime":"17:44","endTime":"17:46"},{"sentence":"And then the latest PRD documents, I will share that with you.","startTime":"17:47","endTime":"17:51"},{"sentence":"But I do think that you should build it within the tool.","startTime":"17:58","endTime":"18:01"},{"sentence":"Yes, it has to go in the tool for sure.","startTime":"18:03","endTime":"18:05"},{"sentence":"I'm building outside the tool just to build quickly, back and forth, opposite.","startTime":"18:05","endTime":"18:09"},{"sentence":"Building in the database.","startTime":"18:09","endTime":"18:11"},{"sentence":"Yeah, to me it just wants to find things to happen really fast and then figuring out, port it over to the tool.","startTime":"18:14","endTime":"18:21"},{"sentence":"If there's anything I should be considering about the tool infrastructure, I think there's some sort of overhaul going on.","startTime":"18:22","endTime":"18:28"},{"sentence":"But if I should build with it in mind, is there anything because Carlos is more for you that it should already start porting it over so it just works easier when we go to translate it.","startTime":"18:28","endTime":"18:41"},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think the logic is easy enough to port over, but if you're building it in Python or anything and we want to keep it as you have it, then maybe it would be easier to just use an iframe like we have for Jack's admin dashboard.","startTime":"18:42","endTime":"18:55"},{"sentence":"That way you can maintain it if you want to keep adding to it.","startTime":"18:55","endTime":"18:57"},{"sentence":"I think I want to avoid the iframes going forward because thing is, it's.","startTime":"18:58","endTime":"19:04"},{"sentence":"I mean, I agree, but.","startTime":"19:04","endTime":"19:05"},{"sentence":"Okay, yeah, you're right.","startTime":"19:07","endTime":"19:08"},{"sentence":"Because technically, like Greg, whenever you have an issue with the admin dashboard, I'm always pointing you to Jack because she maintains that.","startTime":"19:08","endTime":"19:14"},{"sentence":"And so that this would be something that you would have to maintain going forward.","startTime":"19:14","endTime":"19:16"},{"sentence":"Do we want to get away from that?","startTime":"19:17","endTime":"19:19"},{"sentence":"I think like just we should have it all in one app and because like, think about, you're doing this UI redesign.","startTime":"19:20","endTime":"19:31"},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"19:31","endTime":"19:31"},{"sentence":"Like my iframe will not be part of that unless I do it separately, you know, So I just think like everything.","startTime":"19:31","endTime":"19:41"},{"sentence":"If we want to white Label this.","startTime":"19:42","endTime":"19:43"},{"sentence":"It has to be one package, so let's avoid like refactoring in the future.","startTime":"19:43","endTime":"19:48"},{"sentence":"Got it.","startTime":"19:49","endTime":"19:49"},{"sentence":"So no iPhone.","startTime":"19:49","endTime":"19:50"},{"sentence":"No.","startTime":"19:50","endTime":"19:51"},{"sentence":"So react components are cool.","startTime":"19:53","endTime":"19:55"},{"sentence":"I don't know any of the details, but Carlos has a development standard thing that we can share.","startTime":"19:56","endTime":"20:02"},{"sentence":"You just feed it in and it should help you do things the right way.","startTime":"20:03","endTime":"20:07"},{"sentence":"All right, so I think this will be.","startTime":"20:10","endTime":"20:12"},{"sentence":"This is really good feedback.","startTime":"20:12","endTime":"20:13"},{"sentence":"I want to actually continue iterating a little further based upon this feedback.","startTime":"20:14","endTime":"20:18"},{"sentence":"I will take the PRD document, get it set up, share with you all.","startTime":"20:20","endTime":"20:25"},{"sentence":"And it was going to a separate time with Dave and then on my end I also have to talk to Joanna who I have today to get alignment on what question she wants answered.","startTime":"20:25","endTime":"20:37"},{"sentence":"I do think the three approaches, like the natural language, the static dashboard.","startTime":"20:37","endTime":"20:41"},{"sentence":"Oh, and the legend, like here they are kicking your ass.","startTime":"20:44","endTime":"20:49"},{"sentence":"Also, this is just September, so I think like maybe we frame it as like a facilitator helper and keep the cohort separate.","startTime":"20:52","endTime":"21:01"},{"sentence":"But eventually like huge value in having comparisons across cohorts and across time staff too.","startTime":"21:01","endTime":"21:08"},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"21:08","endTime":"21:10"},{"sentence":"The data for March was messy.","startTime":"21:10","endTime":"21:12"},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"21:12","endTime":"21:13"},{"sentence":"June is not the best either.","startTime":"21:14","endTime":"21:16"},{"sentence":"So September's is pretty good.","startTime":"21:16","endTime":"21:18"},{"sentence":"Yeah, September's is pretty good.","startTime":"21:19","endTime":"21:20"},{"sentence":"I think we're getting there.","startTime":"21:20","endTime":"21:22"},{"sentence":"Yep.","startTime":"21:22","endTime":"21:22"},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"21:24","endTime":"21:24"},{"sentence":"And then also all the analysis and feedback and grades are serving BigQuery.","startTime":"21:26","endTime":"21:33"},{"sentence":"I'm not sure if you've ever connected there, but I can give you the information.","startTime":"21:33","endTime":"21:36"},{"sentence":"Yeah, it might look like it's.","startTime":"21:37","endTime":"21:38"},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"21:41","endTime":"21:44"},{"sentence":"I think there's also like an educational component to this for anyone who's like stepping into it either internally or if we are productizing this, they can easily understand.","startTime":"21:44","endTime":"21:53"},{"sentence":"Here's what the grading system looks like and here's how you interpret the grades.","startTime":"21:53","endTime":"21:57"},{"sentence":"Maybe that's a component of this overall dashboard.","startTime":"21:59","endTime":"22:05"},{"sentence":"And maybe this whole thing should actually be run off BigQuery.","startTime":"22:06","endTime":"22:09"},{"sentence":"We have the whole database live duplicated in BigQuery on top of this.","startTime":"22:09","endTime":"22:15"},{"sentence":"It's better for like frequent.","startTime":"22:17","endTime":"22:20"},{"sentence":"It's better for processing data and I don't really know, honestly, but it's made for this, made for querying and analytics.","startTime":"22:20","endTime":"22:31"},{"sentence":"So what am I doing right now?","startTime":"22:31","endTime":"22:32"},{"sentence":"Where's it going?","startTime":"22:32","endTime":"22:33"},{"sentence":"It's pulling directly from a database.","startTime":"22:33","endTime":"22:35"},{"sentence":"Yep.","startTime":"22:36","endTime":"22:36"},{"sentence":"When you call the database, what is that difference?","startTime":"22:37","endTime":"22:39"},{"sentence":"What's it called?","startTime":"22:40","endTime":"22:40"},{"sentence":"This is like the SQL postgres database, which is like a.","startTime":"22:41","endTime":"22:45"},{"sentence":"What do they call it, Carlos, when you're like accessing it all the time?","startTime":"22:45","endTime":"22:49"},{"sentence":"Direct connection SQL instance is what it is.","startTime":"22:51","endTime":"22:55"},{"sentence":"BigQuery sits on top of the Postgres database.","startTime":"22:57","endTime":"23:01"},{"sentence":"Both are powered by Google.","startTime":"23:01","endTime":"23:03"},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"23:04","endTime":"23:04"},{"sentence":"BigQuery is like analytics layer on top of it.","startTime":"23:05","endTime":"23:11"},{"sentence":"So you have all the data, but you can work with it in more flexible ways.","startTime":"23:11","endTime":"23:14"},{"sentence":"Like, the joins aren't as harsh.","startTime":"23:14","endTime":"23:16"},{"sentence":"It's just, like, easier to query.","startTime":"23:17","endTime":"23:18"},{"sentence":"Interesting.","startTime":"23:19","endTime":"23:20"},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"23:21","endTime":"23:22"},{"sentence":"But yeah, I should have a better answer to that.","startTime":"23:23","endTime":"23:25"},{"sentence":"But it's easy to use and that's what it's made for, so we should at least explore it.","startTime":"23:25","endTime":"23:29"},{"sentence":"Do you send the query to BigQuery or are you in BigQuery making queries?","startTime":"23:30","endTime":"23:35"},{"sentence":"Either one.","startTime":"23:36","endTime":"23:37"},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"23:37","endTime":"23:37"},{"sentence":"Like, I.","startTime":"23:38","endTime":"23:38"},{"sentence":"Here, I'll quickly show you.","startTime":"23:39","endTime":"23:41"},{"sentence":"And so this is it.","startTime":"23:42","endTime":"23:57"},{"sentence":"All of our.","startTime":"24:00","endTime":"24:01"},{"sentence":"This pilot agent public is Carlos's database.","startTime":"24:01","endTime":"24:06"},{"sentence":"All of the tables and all the builder data are mirrored here.","startTime":"24:07","endTime":"24:12"},{"sentence":"I can query all of that, but then also I can create new tables and create, like, scheduled queries and stuff that saves here without actually impacting the database.","startTime":"24:12","endTime":"24:26"},{"sentence":"So, like, for example, I save, like, all of this is all, like, the assessment
